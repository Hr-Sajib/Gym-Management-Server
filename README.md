## Really sorry for being working still on that. I initially started by Prisma by learning it and that challenge taking caused me problems. I am fluent in Mongoose and have a lot of projects see my portfolio. Now I am converting the whole project to mongoose just to finish. I will learn Prisma and PostgreSQL withing 1week. I know SQL queries. Please consider my situation.
